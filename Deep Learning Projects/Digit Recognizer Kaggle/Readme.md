# MNIST- Digit Recognizer
This is a neural network designed to train on the MNIST data set for recognizing handwritten digits. It is run with an input layer of 784 inputs (28x28 images) and 2 hidden layers, each with 15 neurons. The output layer has 10 neurons, each of which represents the probability that the image is the digit 0-9, in order. The sigmoid activation function is used.

The data set used to train this is the MNIST data set, found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data. The training data set (60,000 images) is used for everything; it is split 75/25% for training and testing, respectively.

### Python Implementation
Dataset- MNIST dataset
Images of size 28 X 28
Classify digits from 0 to 9
